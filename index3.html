    <h1>My Phone</h1>
    <h2>Components that my phone is made out of</h2>

    <p>The phone is made out of aluminum making it lighter than the pro</p>

    <p>The camera uses ProMotion to make animations more smooth as well as The cameras use Apple's latest computational photography engine, called Smart HDR 4.</p>

    <p>The iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini use an Apple-designed A15 Bionic system on a chip. The iPhone 13 and 13 Mini feature a 6-core CPU, 4-core GPU, and 16-core Neural Engine, while the iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max feature a 5-core GPU.</p>

    <p>Some iPhone 13 parts are paired to the motherboard. The user is warned if a paired component (e.g. screen, battery) is replaced by independent repair shops. The Face ID sensors completely cease to function upon third-party replacement, although on later iOS versions Apple has reverted this limitation. Apple technicians have a proprietary software tool to pair components.</p>

    <p>I have an apple made sillicon phone case that protects the phone as well</p>
